# Question : Find Length of Linked List

Given head of a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: head : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 5, as there 
are 5 nodes present in it.

Input: head : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 7, as there 
are 7 nodes present in it.


# Solution

'''
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head=None
        self.tail=None
'''
class Solution:
    def getCount(self, head):
        # code here
        count = 0
        
        start = head
        
        while start is not None:
            count = count + 1
            start = start.next
            
        return count

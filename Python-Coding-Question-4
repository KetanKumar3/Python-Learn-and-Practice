# Question : Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.

# Solution

class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        # Code Here
        first_number = arr[0]
        second_number = -1;
        
        if len(arr) == 1:
            return -1;
        
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > first_number:
                second_number = first_number
                first_number = arr[i];
            elif arr[i] > second_number and arr[i] < first_number:
                second_number = arr[i]
                
        return second_number

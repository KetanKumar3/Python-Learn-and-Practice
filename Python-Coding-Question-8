# Question : You are given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x, insert that value x at the end of the LinkedList and return the head of the modified Linked List.

Examples :

Input: x = 6,
   
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
Explanation: We can see that 6 is inserted at the end of the linkedlist.
   
Input: x = 1,
   
Output: 4 -> 5 -> 1
Explanation: We can see that 1 is inserted at the end of the linked list.

# Solution 

'''    
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
'''

class Solution:
    def insertAtEnd(self, head, x):
        #code here 
        newNode = Node(x)
        current = head
        
        if head is None:
            return newNode
            
        while current.next is not None:
            current = current.next
            
        current.next = newNode
        
        return head

# Solution

'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.data = x
        self.next = None
'''

class Solution:
    def printList(self, head):
        # code here
        start = head
        temp = []
        
        while start is not None:
            temp.append(start.data)
            start = start.next
            
        return temp
